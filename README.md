# Q-Learning-Taxi-v3 

This project implements a simple reinforcement learning (RL) agent using Q-learning from scratch. The agent is trained to pick up and drop off passengers in the classic `Taxi-v3` environment from OpenAI Gym.

### Key Concepts:
- Tabular Q-learning with epsilon-greedy exploration
- Training over 10,000 episodes
- Custom hyperparameters for learning rate, discount factor, and exploration decay
- Visual rendering using `pygame`

### Requirements

Create and activate a virtual environment, then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run Training

python deep-q-learning.py
